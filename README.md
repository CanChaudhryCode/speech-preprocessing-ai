# Speech Preprocessing for AI

## Programming for AI – Individual Project

This repository contains a complete speech data preprocessing pipeline implemented as part of the **Programming for AI** course project. The goal of this project is to prepare raw audio data for use in machine learning and deep learning models.

---

## Dataset

- **LibriSpeech (test-clean subset)**
- Publicly available speech dataset
- Contains high-quality English audiobook recordings

---

## Preprocessing Steps

The following preprocessing techniques are applied:

1. Audio loading
2. Resampling to 16 kHz
3. Amplitude normalization
4. Silence trimming
5. Feature extraction (MFCCs)

---

## Feature Extraction

- **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** are extracted
- Features are visualized using heatmaps
- Final features are combined into a single tensor for ML models
